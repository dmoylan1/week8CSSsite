					<h2>Our Famous Basic Bread Recipe</h2>
                    <img src="images/bread.jpg">
					<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast</li>
                        <li>3 tablespoons plus 1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
                        <li>2-1/4 cups warm water (110째 to 115째)</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
                        <li>6-1/4 to 6-3/4 cups bread flour</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
                    </ul>
					<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and 1/2 teaspoon sugar in warm water; let stand until bubbles 
                            form on surface. Whisk together remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, salt and 3 cups flour. 
                            Stir oil into yeast mixture; pour into flour mixture and beat until smooth. Stir in enough 
                            remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to form a soft dough.</li>
                        <li>Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 8-10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, 
                            turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, 1-1/2 to 2 hours.</li>
                        <li>Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide dough in half. Shape each into a loaf. 
                            Place in 2 greased 9x5-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, 1 to 1-1/2 hours.</li>
                        <li>Bake at 375째 until loaf is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped or has reached an internal 
                            temperature of 200째, 30-35 minutes. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.</li>
                    </ol>
